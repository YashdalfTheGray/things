## CardToken

A Magic The Gathering token that is exactly (within tolerances) 1/4 the width of an MTG card so that it can be stacked 4 in a row inside a deck box. It also has stacking pins so that you can stack it to denote an increase in attack and toughness.

Two versions, one with the `1/1` offset so that other tags can be added to the left of the `1/1` and one with `1/1` centered if other tags aren't needed.

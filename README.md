## CardToken

A Magic The Gathering token that is exactly (within tolerances) 1/4 the width of an MTG card so that it can be stacked 4 in a row inside a deck box. It also has stacking pins so that you can stack it to denote an increase in attack and toughness.

Two versions, one with the `1/1` offset so that other tags can be added to the left of the `1/1` and one with `1/1` centered if other tags aren't needed.

## OmTag

This one was a request from the family members. I recreated a design that I saw on Thingiverse a while ago but couldn't find it again when I looked for it when the family request came in. It's just a little tag with [the ‡•ê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om) on it.

## AmiiboHolder

This is a remix of [this project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:754095) on thingiverse. I wanted something that I would be able to stack in a tiered formation and interlock with each other. So I added pins to the bottom and top of this project and created a spacer (so that you can tier) and a cap (so that you can use it for other things besides an Amiibo).

## PlayerDashboardCarrier

This one's a simple one. It's just a box that can hold 4 Gloomhaven player dashboards, specifically [these ones](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3024359) on thingiverse. because of their shape, they're sorta awkward to carry alongside the game so this box helps with that.

## Circuits

This is a replication of the Factorio {Green|Red|Blue} circuits but in real life. I'm also using this project to test out parametric 3D modeling on the iPad and it seems like most people recommend something called Shapr3D. The additional thing we're testing is if 3mf is a better format since Shapr3D can also export 3mf and my Bambu printer understands 3mf, well, the slicer understand 3mf.

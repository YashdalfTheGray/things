## CardToken

A Magic The Gathering token that is exactly (within tolerances) 1/4 the width of an MTG card so that it can be stacked 4 in a row inside a deck box. It also has stacking pins so that you can stack it to denote an increase in attack and toughness.

Two versions, one with the `1/1` offset so that other tags can be added to the left of the `1/1` and one with `1/1` centered if other tags aren't needed.

## OmTag

This one was a request from the family members. I recreated a design that I saw on Thingiverse a while ago but couldn't find it again when I looked for it when the family request came in. It's just a little tag with [the ‡•ê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om) on it.

## AmiiboHolder

This is a remix of [this project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:754095) on thingiverse. I wanted something that I would be able to stack in a tiered formation and interlock with each other. So I added pins to the bottom and top of this project and created a spacer (so that you can tier) and a cap (so that you can use it for other things besides an Amiibo).
